UCLA legend and Olympic decathlete Rafer Johnson, who graduated in 1959, carried the torch into the Los Angeles Coliseum during the Olympic commencement ceremony. The campus was transformed into an international Olympic Village. The “hill” housed more than 4,000 athletes, coaches and trainers from over 62 different countries. Pauley Pavilion and the Tennis Center were sporting event hubs where both gymnastics and tennis athletes competed for the podium. Our institution, asid from hosting the games, was represented by 60 athletes and coaches, the largest number from any university. In 1984 we brought home a total of 37 medals, 17 of which were gold.</span></p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/173/files/20167/1984OlympicVillage02.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="" width="549" height="454"></figure><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/173/files/20167/1984OlympicVillage02.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="" width="549" height="454"></figure><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alumni Support Grows</span></h2><figure class="post__image"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 1980s were a decade of growth for UCLA’s Alumni network. The Alumni Association began to recognize the importance of a strong network to continue building and strengthening the Bruin spirit post graduation. The Student Alumni Association (SAA) was established in 1984 to further hone the UCLA alumni ties. Five years later, in 1989, the UCLA Latino Alumni Association (ULAA) was founded for a way to Latino alumni to stay connected, get involved and support future generations of UCLA students. The UCLA Lambda (LGBTQ) Alumni Association was established by Doug Walters and Corinne Lightweaver in 1989. This organization’s mission is to connect current students with past students through social professional networking and community outreach.</span><img loading="lazy" src="https://newsletter.alumni.ucla.edu/connect/2020/jan/ucla-in-the-1980s/images/Homecoming.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="" width="563" height="939"></figure><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Politics &amp; Activism in the 1980's</span></h2><figure class="post__image"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Half way through the decade, in 1985, 2,000 protestors boycotted classes and gathered on UCLA’s campus for a rally. The political activism was centered around the South African government’s apartheid politics and affirmative action. The protestors, on that day, demanded that the UC system divest funds from companies that did business with South Africa. They set up tents in the sunken gardens in front of Murphy Hall and called the area “Mandela City,” in support of Nelson Mandela’s efforts in Africa. In 1988, UCLA’s Pauley Pavilion became the center stage for the final presidential campaign. President George Bush and Governor Michael Dukakis gave their speeches in the auditorium, making Pauley a television studio with miles of cable, 412 telephones and 40 UCLA student-users. President Bush went on to win the election and Dukakis became a visiting professor at the School of Public Affairs.</span><img loading="lazy" src="https://newsletter.alumni.ucla.edu/connect/2020/jan/ucla-in-the-1980s/images/Bush%20vs.%20Dukakis%20Vice%20Presidential%20Debate%20in%20Pauley%20Pavilion.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="" width="410" height="462"></figure><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://calisphere.org/clip/500x500/e2d54189c817d3d5ca5d3ea2270bfd20" data-is-external-image="true" alt="" width="500" height="381"></figure><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://calisphere.org/clip/500x500/56aeaee467b1738792882042a5c86973" data-is-external-image="true" alt="" width="500" height="330"></figure><br><br><p></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">LA Riots/Rebellion</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, April 29, 1992, a California jury acquitted four Los Angeles police officers who were videotaped beating African American motorist Rodney King. The “not guilty” verdict led to a wave of civil unrest across Los Angeles. This sentiment reached our campus, as students smashed windows and looted stores in our very own Westwood Village. Even though these events took place in the midst of midterms, the Chancellor Charles Young, shut down the campus. Student organizations led different riots and spoke up about the civil rights issues that were at the heart of the rebellion.</span></p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://placesjournal.org/assets/legacy/media/images/Sides_LA-Riots-4_525.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="" width="525" height="369"></figure><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expansion of UCLA</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 1990s, the University of California, Los Angeles grew as a campus and as a faculty and student body. UCLA opened its Bruin Woods family camp to alumni and current students. Alumni leaders wanted to open a vacation and conference center for the UCLA community in Lake Arrowhead. Donald Findley, who had pioneered the creation of Bruin Woods, also played a pivotal role in creating the Treehouse, Kerckhoff Coffee House, North Campus Student Center and the Cooperage. The Fowler Museum was founded in 1992 after having raised over $20 million to build the new structure. It was created to house the 30,000 artifacts donated mainly from archeological digs all around the world. The museum currently holds over 170,000 pieces from contemporary, historic and prehistoric cultures. Lastly, UCLA’s Luskin School of Public Affairs opened its doors in 1994, followed by the Anderson School of Management in 1995. </span></p><p>Here is a soundscape depicting what Kerkhoff Coffee House sounds like today:</p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="640" height="480" src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14t9E4zghtYDJ6t3l0zz3s3XEvmtLw38-/preview" allow="autoplay"></iframe></div><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.alumni.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/rt-history-8.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="" width="574" height="339"></figure><h2><a href="https://oliviatruong.github.io/FinalProject/2000s-to-present-day/">2000's to Present Day🡒</a></h2></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><div class="post__share"></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p><a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"><img style="border-width: 0;" src="https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc/4.0/80x15.png" alt="Creative Commons License"></a><br>This work is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License.</a></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://oliviatruong.github.io/FinalProject/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
