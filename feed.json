Students, such as Tam Tran and Cinthya Felix Perez, led the fight for undocumetned students’ civil rights in the US and on campus. These two individuals co-founded the student group IDEAS (Improving Dreams, Equality, Access and Success) and Tam Tran even testified before Congress in 2007, just a year after graduating from UCLA.

The campus was transformed into an international Olympic Village. The “hill” housed more than 4,000 athletes, coaches and trainers from over 62 different countries. Pauley Pavilion and the Tennis Center were sporting event hubs where both gymnastics and tennis athletes competed for the podium.

The Alumni Association began to recognize the importance of a strong network to continue building and strengthening the Bruin spirit post graduation. The Student Alumni Association (SAA) was established in 1984 to further hone the UCLA alumni ties. Five years later, in 1989, the UCLA Latino Alumni Association (ULAA) was founded for a way to Latino alumni to stay connected, get involved and support future generations of UCLA students. The UCLA Lambda (LGBTQ) Alumni Association was established by Doug Walters and Corinne Lightweaver in 1989. This organization’s mission is to connect current students with past students through social professional networking and community outreach.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://newsletter.alumni.ucla.edu/connect/2020/jan/ucla-in-the-1980s/images/Homecoming.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"\" width=\"329\" height=\"549\">\n<figcaption >UCLA Homecoming in the '80s</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Politics &amp; Activism in the 1980's</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Half way through the decade, in 1985, 2,000 protestors boycotted classes and gathered on UCLA’s campus for a rally. The political activism was centered around the South African government’s apartheid politics and affirmative action. The protestors, on that day, demanded that the UC system divest funds from companies that did business with South Africa. They set up tents in the sunken gardens in front of Murphy Hall and called the area “Mandela City,” in support of Nelson Mandela’s efforts in Africa. In 1988, UCLA’s Pauley Pavilion became the center stage for the final presidential campaign. President George Bush and Governor Michael Dukakis gave their speeches in the auditorium, making Pauley a television studio with miles of cable, 412 telephones and 40 UCLA student-users. President Bush went on to win the election and Dukakis became a visiting professor at the School of Public Affairs.</span></p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://DigitalStoryofUCLA.github.io/FinalProject/media/posts/6/gallery/56aeaee467b1738792882042a5c86973.jpg\" data-size=\"500x330\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://DigitalStoryofUCLA.github.io/FinalProject/media/posts/6/gallery/56aeaee467b1738792882042a5c86973-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"330\"></a>\n<figcaption>UC Regents' demonstration, UCLA</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://DigitalStoryofUCLA.github.io/FinalProject/media/posts/6/gallery/e2d54189c817d3d5ca5d3ea2270bfd20.jpg\" data-size=\"500x381\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://DigitalStoryofUCLA.github.io/FinalProject/media/posts/6/gallery/e2d54189c817d3d5ca5d3ea2270bfd20-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"381\"></a>\n<figcaption>Anti-apartheid protesters at UCLA</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://DigitalStoryofUCLA.github.io/FinalProject/media/posts/6/gallery/Bush-vs.-Dukakis-Vice-Presidential-Debate-in-Pauley-Pavilion.jpg\" data-size=\"410x462\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://DigitalStoryofUCLA.github.io/FinalProject/media/posts/6/gallery/Bush-vs.-Dukakis-Vice-Presidential-Debate-in-Pauley-Pavilion-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"410\" height=\"462\"></a>\n<figcaption>Bush vs. Dukakis Vice Presidential Debate in Pauley Pavilion</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LA Riots/Rebellion</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Wednesday, April 29, 1992, a California jury acquitted four Los Angeles police officers who were videotaped beating African American motorist Rodney King. The “not guilty” verdict led to a wave of civil unrest across Los Angeles. This sentiment reached our campus, as students smashed windows and looted stores in our very own Westwood Village. Even though these events took place in the midst of midterms, the Chancellor Charles Young, shut down the campus. Student organizations led different riots and spoke up about the civil rights issues that were at the heart of the rebellion.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://placesjournal.org/assets/legacy/media/images/Sides_LA-Riots-4_525.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"\" width=\"447\" height=\"314\">\n<figcaption >Los Angeles Riots</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expansion of UCLA</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the 1990s, the University of California, Los Angeles grew as a campus and as a faculty and student body. UCLA opened its Bruin Woods family camp to alumni and current students. Alumni leaders wanted to open a vacation and conference center for the UCLA community in Lake Arrowhead. Donald Findley, who had pioneered the creation of Bruin Woods, also played a pivotal role in creating the Treehouse, Kerckhoff Coffee House, North Campus Student Center and the Cooperage. The Fowler Museum was founded in 1992 after having raised over $20 million to build the new structure. It was created to house the 30,000 artifacts donated mainly from archeological digs all around the world. The museum currently holds over 170,000 pieces from contemporary, historic and prehistoric cultures. Lastly, UCLA’s Luskin School of Public Affairs opened its doors in 1994, followed by the Anderson School of Management in 1995. </span></p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"2\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://DigitalStoryofUCLA.github.io/FinalProject/media/posts/6/gallery/rt-history-8.jpg\" data-size=\"390x230\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://DigitalStoryofUCLA.github.io/FinalProject/media/posts/6/gallery/rt-history-8-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"390\" height=\"230\"></a>\n<figcaption>Bruin Woods</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://DigitalStoryofUCLA.github.io/FinalProject/media/posts/6/gallery/UCLA-Anderson-School-of-Management.png\" data-size=\"1600x1293\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://DigitalStoryofUCLA.github.io/FinalProject/media/posts/6/gallery/UCLA-Anderson-School-of-Management-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"582\"></a>\n<figcaption>Anderson School of Management</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>Here is a soundscape depicting what Kerkhoff Coffee House sounds like today:</p>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/14t9E4zghtYDJ6t3l0zz3s3XEvmtLw38-/preview\" allow=\"autoplay\"></iframe></div>\n<h3><a href=\"https://DigitalStoryofUCLA.github.io/FinalProject/2000s-to-present-day/\">2000's to Present Day</a></h3>",

UCLA’s Chancellor at the time, Franklin David Murphy, strived to develop and increase our institution's autonomy. The major features signed into law that were adopted starting in 1960 were as follows:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Differentiation of functions among public postsecondary education would be the UC system (University of California), CSU (California State University), and California Community Colleges. This key distinction allowed each UC to obtain exclusive jurisdiction in public higher education for doctoral degrees in law, medicine, dentistry, and veterinary medicine.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"3\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Establishment of different admission pools and acceptance rates among these three groups of institutions. The UCs from then on would select students among the top 12.5% of the high school graduating class.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"3\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reaffirmation of California’s commitment to the principle of tuition-free education to residents of the state. Costs of tuition would be covered, but additional expenses including dormitories and recreational facilities would not be covered.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Student Unrest/Civil Rights Movement</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 1960s were some of the most divisive decades in world history, specifically in the United States. Political turmoil and civil unrest emerged as students were against the US’s involvement in the Vietnam War. Presidents such as John F. Kennedy,  Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon, and former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt all gave speeches on our campus. On January 17, 1969, UCLA Students and Black Panther Party members, John Huggins and Bunchy Carter were murdered in Campbell Hall by a rival black power organization called United Slaves. Earlier in the decade, in 1965, Martin Luther King came to UCLA to deliver his “Segregation Must Die” speech to the students and faculty of our institution. He inspired individuals to take action against segregation, to go out to vote and to propel the civil rights movement forward.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://newsletter.alumni.ucla.edu/connect/2019/oct/ucla-in-the-1960s/images/Vietnam%20Protest.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"\" width=\"363\" height=\"321\">\n<figcaption >Students protesting</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Here is a soundscape of what MLK's \"Segregation Must Die\" speech sounded like:</p>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dZG9nsmqBeaMFWERteCF4UDMDKxS816a/preview\" allow=\"autoplay\"></iframe></div>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creation of Inverted Fountain (1968)</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chancellor Franklin Murphy played a pivotal role in UCLA’s history. While serving as Chancellor of the college for eight years, he pioneered the creation of the iconic Inverted Fountain— nowadays found in between the psychology and music buildings. Murphy challenged the architectural landscape by tasking Howard Troller and Jere Hazlett to create a modern vision of Yellowstone Park’s natural beauty. Given the wind tunnel in Franz Hall Court, an inverted fountain was necessary in order to avoid water from being splashed on students, faculty and visitors. The fountain was completed in 1968, during Murphy’s last year as chancellor, and has since become an emblem of UCLA’s campus and has been used in multiple campus traditions. Incoming first-year students come to the fountain to become “bruintized” during their summer orientation and fourth-year students jump in the fountain after they are done with their last spring final, celebrating that they are done with their undergraduate college career.</span></p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://DigitalStoryofUCLA.github.io/FinalProject/media/posts/5/gallery/New-student-orientation-1.jpg\" data-size=\"5184x3456\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://DigitalStoryofUCLA.github.io/FinalProject/media/posts/5/gallery/New-student-orientation-1-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\"></a>\n<figcaption>New students get officially 'Bruintized' in the inverted fountain during a campus orientation tour.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://DigitalStoryofUCLA.github.io/FinalProject/media/posts/5/gallery/image-asset.jpeg\" data-size=\"300x300\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://DigitalStoryofUCLA.github.io/FinalProject/media/posts/5/gallery/image-asset-thumbnail.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\"></a>\n<figcaption>Inverted fountain graduation tradition</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://DigitalStoryofUCLA.github.io/FinalProject/media/posts/5/gallery/IMG_1632-1.JPG\" data-size=\"640x480\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://DigitalStoryofUCLA.github.io/FinalProject/media/posts/5/gallery/IMG_1632-1-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\"></a>\n<figcaption>One of our creators, Leti, being Bruintized!</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creation of Internet</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ARPANET, the world’s first electronic computer network, was created at the University of California, Los Angeles in 1969. The program was first deployed by a student programmer, named Charley Kline, who was supervised by Professor Leonard Kleinrock. On October 29, 1969 the first message was sent from UCLA’s computer in Boelter Hall to Douglas Engelbart’s lab at Stanford. The entire message should have been “LOGIN,” but Stanford’s system crashed and thus only the first two letters, “LO,” were sent. UCLA is known as the birthplace of the ARPANET, which is the precursor to the modern internet. The creation of this program was sponsored by the Department of Defense for new technologies and was then expanded to other UC schools and universities.</span></p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"2\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://DigitalStoryofUCLA.github.io/FinalProject/media/posts/5/gallery/internet_lab-1.jpg\" data-size=\"600x400\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://DigitalStoryofUCLA.github.io/FinalProject/media/posts/5/gallery/internet_lab-1-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></a>\n<figcaption>Birthplace of the Internet</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://DigitalStoryofUCLA.github.io/FinalProject/media/posts/5/gallery/6300000486_97de1a2029_o.0.0.1515092991.0.webp\" data-size=\"920x613\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://DigitalStoryofUCLA.github.io/FinalProject/media/posts/5/gallery/6300000486_97de1a2029_o.0.0.1515092991.0-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\"></a>\n<figcaption>Recreated 1989 birthplace of the internet</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<h3><a href=\"https://DigitalStoryofUCLA.github.io/FinalProject/1970s-1990s/\">1970's - 1990's </a></h3>",

On October 19, 1945, the Board of Regents approved its creation and passed a $7 million appropriation bill to fund the new school. Stafford L. Warren became the school’s first dean and appointed the first faculty members to the school. He chose Andrew Dowdy as the first professor of radiology, John Lawrence as the first professor of medicine; and Cahrles Carpenter as the first professor of infectious diseases. UCLA’s first class of medical students began their studies in the fall of 2021 and consisted of 28 students, 26 men and 2 women. It wasn’t until 2002, 57 years after its inception, that the school received a name. Media mogul, David Geffen, donated a $200 million endowment and thus the medical school was named after him (David Geffen School of Medicine).</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First “Golden Age” of UCLA Athletics</span></h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BASKETBALL</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John Wooden, nicknamed the Wizard of Westwood, is a UCLA icon. His statue proudly stands in front of Pauley Pavilion where he led our basketball team to 10 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) championships in 12 seasons. The Bruins won these titles with dominant players such as Karem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Walton, and Walt Hazzard. During Wooden’s time as Coach he registered 620 wins and only 147 losses, earning UCLA more honors and titles than any other university in the nation. The UCLA basketball team prospered during a golden age in Los Angeles sports as other teams such as the Dodgers, Lakers and the USC football team conquered other national titles (Dwyre and Wharton, 2014). John Wooden’s legacy persists at UCLA through his pyramid of success— the steps that all UCLA athletes and students must follow to achieve whole success.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2021/11/10145059/GettyImages-640699536-1024x683.jpeg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"\" width=\"447\" height=\"298\">\n<figcaption >John Wooden</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Here is a soundscape of what a basketball game sounds like in present day:</p>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/18WV_J8jSQZ4m4_kscPU7Gb2XfhIv_EQ0/preview\" allow=\"autoplay\"></iframe></div>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FOOTBALL</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Henry Russell Sanders became UCLA’s head football coach in 1949, just a couple years after World War II had ended. Known as “Red” by the sports community, he was head coach at our institution for nine years and during these nine seasons, Bruin football won 66 games, lost 19 and tied once. His team finished first three times in the Pacific Coast Conference in consecutive years: 1953, 1954, and 1955. He originated the quote “winning isn't everything, it’s the only thing” and his teams’ wins gave rise to the UCLA-USC rivalry. Red Sanders, would have continued to coach the Bruins and lead them to victory, but he unexpectedly passed away in 1958, before he could do so. Additionally, in 1962, Pasadena’s the Rose Bowl became the UCLA Bruins official home stadium.

As Los Angeles established a public school system, residents campaigned to create an institution of higher education in Los Angeles as well to serve the growing population. In 1881, California Governor George C. Perkins granted that by signing California Senate Bill 187 into law, creating the Branch State Normal School of California in Los Angeles. The school opened in 1882 in Downtown Los Angeles before moving to East Hollywood in 1914 under the name Los Angeles State Normal School. As Los Angeles continued to grow in size, residents began advocating for a local branch of the University of California. After much debate, the university president agreed and in May 1919 Governor William D. Stephens signed Assembly Bill 626, creating the Southern Branch of the University of California. </span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/homesteadmuseum.blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/la-normal-school-1890s.jpg?fit=2582%2C1509&amp;ssl=1\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"First Campus\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1169\">\n<figcaption >First Campus</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Los Angeles State Normal School was transformed into the Southern Branch of the University of California and officially opened in September 1919 with over 1500 students. Originally, the Southern Branch offered only a two-year undergraduate program and as a result those who wanted to pursue a bachelor’s degree had to transfer to UC Berkeley or another college. After a strong campaign from the faculty and student body, in 1924 the UC Regents approved the Southern Branch as a four-year degree-granting institution and in 1925 the Southern Branch awarded the first ever Bachelor of Arts degree to 100 women and 24 men. </span></p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper gallery-wrapper--full\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"2\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://DigitalStoryofUCLA.github.io/FinalProject/media/posts/3/gallery/1923-Regents-Rally.png\" data-size=\"724x384\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://DigitalStoryofUCLA.github.io/FinalProject/media/posts/3/gallery/1923-Regents-Rally-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"Regents Rally\" width=\"720\" height=\"382\"></a>\n<figcaption>Regents Rally</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://DigitalStoryofUCLA.github.io/FinalProject/media/posts/3/gallery/Vermont-Campus.jpg\" data-size=\"800x560\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://DigitalStoryofUCLA.github.io/FinalProject/media/posts/3/gallery/Vermont-Campus-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Vermont Campus\" width=\"720\" height=\"504\"></a>\n<figcaption>Vermont Campus</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Relocation to Westwood</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the university grew, it relocated from East Hollywood in 1927 to the “Beverly Site”, where UCLA is located today. The land was originally the homelands of Tongva Native Americans before it was granted by the California governor to a Spanish soldier. Eventually, Harold Janss and his brother, the owners of Janss Investment Company, came into ownership of the land and sold it to the university at a discounted price. The Janss Investment Company went on to develop Westwood Village and the surrounding neighborhoods and to this day Janss Steps is named after these two brothers. In 1926, the University Regents changed the name from the Southern Branch to the University of California at Los Angeles and the student council adopted the nickname “the Bruins”. </span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://waterandpower.org/6%20Historic%20Photos%206/Westwood_ca1924.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Westwood, 1924\" width=\"320\" height=\"413\">\n<figcaption >Westwod, 1924</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 1927, construction of the new Westwood campus location began.

Once construction of the original buildings finished, construction of new buildings began. Moore Hall, named after the co-founder of the Southern Branch Ernest Caroll Moore,  and Kerckhoff Hall, named after William G. Kerckhoff, were some of the first additions. The summer of 1932 the Olympics came to Los Angeles and some of the events took place in UCLA’s Women’s Gym, now known as Glorya Kaufman Hall. Also in 1932, Albert Einstein gave a lecture about his Theory of Relativity at Royce Hall. In 1933, a Master of Arts degree was approved and by 1935, UCLA formed its first professional school, the College Commerce (now the Anderson School of Management). </span></p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"2\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://DigitalStoryofUCLA.github.io/FinalProject/media/posts/3/gallery/Kerchoff_Hall_-2.jpg\" data-size=\"713x916\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://DigitalStoryofUCLA.github.io/FinalProject/media/posts/3/gallery/Kerchoff_Hall_-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"713\" height=\"916\"></a>\n<figcaption>Kerchoff Hall Opening</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://DigitalStoryofUCLA.github.io/FinalProject/media/posts/3/gallery/UCLA_10-2.jpg\" data-size=\"800x599\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://DigitalStoryofUCLA.github.io/FinalProject/media/posts/3/gallery/UCLA_10-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"539\"></a>\n<figcaption>Women's Gym</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the Great Depression students had an increased interest in communism, socialism, and isolationism. As a result, several communist groups formed on campus. President Moore was strongly opposed to these political groups, and UCLA banned partisan politics on campus. In 1934, students attempted to arrange for author and socialist Upton Sinclair to come speak on campus. When President Moore found out what was going on, he suspended five students for trying to “destroy the university”. This caused large student demonstrations and negative publicity, resulting in the student leaders being reinstated. </span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://newsletter.alumni.ucla.edu/connect/2019/july/ucla-in-the-1930s/images/DailyBruinHeadline.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"\" width=\"363\" height=\"296\">\n<figcaption >Daily Bruin Headline, July 1934</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCLA’s Independence</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up until this point, Berkeley controlled the power and finances of UCLA and often would refuse to support UCLA initiatives. In 1933, UCLA alumni together with faculty and administration petitioned Berkeley for their own association. They passed two resolutions, known as UCLA’s “Declaration of Indepence”, stating that the board must be recognized as an autonomous body and be given the power to make recommendations affecting the University as a whole. The UCLA Alumni Association gained official independence in 1934, establishing its own officers, council, and constitution. As the 1930’s came to a close, UCLA’s enrollment had become close to 10,000 students. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCLA during WWII</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In December 1941, the United States entered World War II, dramatically affecting all aspects of life. Many students and faculty enlisted or were drafted to serve in the military. During the war, enrollment declined by nearly half.  In total, more than 6000 members of the UCLA community served in World War II. The effects of the war could be felt on campus- the Army, Navy, and Air Corps programs moved close to campus, fraternity houses became dormitories and Kerckhoff was turned into a mess hall. A Student War Board was formed to coordinate volunteer efforts, students sold war bonds in Royce Quad and organized blood drives. When President Roosevelet signed Executive Order No. 9066, authorizing the mass removal and incarceration of Japanese Americans living on the West Coast, many Japanese American UCLA students' lives were changed as well. In 1942, the annual USC-UCLA football game fell a few days after the one-year anniversary of Pearl Harbor. To honor the date, students made the game a war bond drive, raising over $2 million. </span></p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"2\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://DigitalStoryofUCLA.github.io/FinalProject/media/posts/3/gallery/BruinStrong_1_Navy_V12.jpg\" data-size=\"1140x1400\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://DigitalStoryofUCLA.github.io/FinalProject/media/posts/3/gallery/BruinStrong_1_Navy_V12-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"884\"></a>\n<figcaption>Bruins in the navy</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://DigitalStoryofUCLA.github.io/FinalProject/media/posts/3/gallery/WarBonds.jpg\" data-size=\"918x668\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://DigitalStoryofUCLA.github.io/FinalProject/media/posts/3/gallery/WarBonds-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"524\"></a>\n<figcaption>Students selling war bonds</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>In 2010, UCLA finally made amends to Japanese American students forced to leave during World War II by presenting honorary degrees almost 70 years later:</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eX24rk3FRgk\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post-war</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the war ended, UCLA started a $38 million construction program through which several of UCLA’s graduate schools such as the engineering, nursing, law, and medical schools were developed. In 1944 the School of Engineering was established following the aerospace work that took place at UCLA during the war. In 1947, Governor Warren authorized $1 million for the construction of a School of Law. The School of Law opened in 1949, making it the first public law school in Southern California. Also in 1949, UC Regents authorized the School of Nursing, as a larger program was needed due to nurses leaving military service and coming to UCLA through the G.I. Bill. </span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.alumni.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/tmih-jul-law1.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"275\">\n<figcaption >School of Law</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3><a href=\"https://DigitalStoryofUCLA.github.io/FinalProject/ucla-during-the-mccarthy-era-and-uclas-golden-age-of-athletics/\">UCLA during the McCarthy Era and UCLA's \"Golden Age of Athletics\"</a></h3>\n<p> </p>",
