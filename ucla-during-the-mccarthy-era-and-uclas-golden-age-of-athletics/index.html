On October 19, 1945, the Board of Regents approved its creation and passed a $7 million appropriation bill to fund the new school. Stafford L. Warren became the school’s first dean and appointed the first faculty members to the school. He chose Andrew Dowdy as the first professor of radiology, John Lawrence as the first professor of medicine; and Cahrles Carpenter as the first professor of infectious diseases. UCLA’s first class of medical students began their studies in the fall of 2021 and consisted of 28 students, 26 men and 2 women. It wasn’t until 2002, 57 years after its inception, that the school received a name. Media mogul, David Geffen, donated a $200 million endowment and thus the medical school was named after him (David Geffen School of Medicine).</span></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">First “Golden Age” of UCLA Athletics</span></h2><h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">BASKETBALL</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Wooden, nicknamed the Wizard of Westwood, is a UCLA icon. His statue proudly stands in front of Pauley Pavilion where he led our basketball team to 10 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) championships in 12 seasons. The Bruins won these titles with dominant players such as Karem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Walton, and Walt Hazzard. During Wooden’s time as Coach he registered 620 wins and only 147 losses, earning UCLA more honors and titles than any other university in the nation. The UCLA basketball team prospered during a golden age in Los Angeles sports as other teams such as the Dodgers, Lakers and the USC football team conquered other national titles (Dwyre and Wharton, 2014). John Wooden’s legacy persists at UCLA through his pyramid of success— the steps that all UCLA athletes and students must follow to achieve whole success.</span></p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2021/11/10145059/GettyImages-640699536-1024x683.jpeg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="" width="1024" height="683"></figure><p>Here is a soundscape of what a basketball game sounds like in present day:</p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="640" height="480" src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/18WV_J8jSQZ4m4_kscPU7Gb2XfhIv_EQ0/preview" allow="autoplay"></iframe></div><p> </p><h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">FOOTBALL</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Henry Russell Sanders became UCLA’s head football coach in 1949, just a couple years after World War II had ended. Known as “Red” by the sports community, he was head coach at our institution for nine years and during these nine seasons, Bruin football won 66 games, lost 19 and tied once. His team finished first three times in the Pacific Coast Conference in consecutive years: 1953, 1954, and 1955. He originated the quote “winning isn't everything, it’s the only thing” and his teams’ wins gave rise to the UCLA-USC rivalry. Red Sanders, would have continued to coach the Bruins and lead them to victory, but he unexpectedly passed away in 1958, before he could do so. Additionally, in 1962, Pasadena’s the Rose Bowl became the UCLA Bruins official home stadium. Millions of Bruins and fans have since gathered at the stadium to support the UCLA football team throughout the seasons.</span></p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://newsletter.alumni.ucla.edu/connect/2020/jan/ucla-in-the-1980s/images/Rose%20Bowl%20became%20home%20of%20UCLA%20Football.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="" width="800" height="450"></figure><h2><a href="https://DigitalStoryofUCLA.github.io/FinalProject/1960s/">1960's🡒</a></h2></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><div class="post__share"></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p><a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"><img style="border-width: 0;" src="https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc/4.0/80x15.png" alt="Creative Commons License"></a><br>This work is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License.</a></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://DigitalStoryofUCLA.github.io/FinalProject/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
